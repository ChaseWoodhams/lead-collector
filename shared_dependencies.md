Since we are only generating a "README.md" file, there are no shared dependencies in the traditional sense, as a README is a standalone document. However, to write a detailed README, we would need to reference various elements of the project that the README describes. These references are not dependencies in the code sense but are informational dependencies that the README would include to be accurate and useful. Here are some of the elements that the README might reference:

- Project Name
- Description of the Project
- Installation Instructions
  - Required Software
  - Dependencies (e.g., libraries, frameworks)
  - Environment Setup (e.g., environment variables)
  - Step-by-step Installation Commands
- Usage Instructions
  - How to Run the Application
  - Basic Usage Examples
- Features List
- Functions Description
  - Function Names
  - Function Parameters
  - Return Values
- API Endpoints (if applicable)
  - Endpoint URLs
  - HTTP Methods
  - Request Parameters
  - Response Format
- Configuration Options
  - Configuration File Name
  - Configuration Parameters
- Database Schema (if applicable)
  - Table Names
  - Column Names
- Contributing Guidelines
  - Instructions for Forking and Submitting Pull Requests
- License Information
  - License Name
- Contact Information for the Maintainers or Contributors

Remember, these are not shared dependencies in the code but rather topics and elements that the README would describe for someone to understand and use the project.
